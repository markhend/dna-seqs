# 6. Let's examine whether there is a benefit to using an index built using subsequences of T rather 
# than substrings, as we discussed in the "Variations on k-mer indexes" video. We'll consider subsequences 
# involving every N characters. For example, if we split ATATAT into two substring partitions, we would 
# get partitions ATA (the first half) and TAT (second half). But if we split ATATAT into two subsequences 
# by taking every other character, we would get AAA (first, third and fifth characters) and TTT 
# (second, fourth and sixth).
# Another way to visualize this is using numbers to show how each character of P is allocated to a partition. 
# Splitting a length-6 pattern into two substrings could be represented as 111222, and splitting into two 
# subsequences of every other character could be represented as 121212
# The following class SubseqIndex is a more general implementation of Index that additionally handles 
# subsequences. It only considers subsequences that take every Nth character:
